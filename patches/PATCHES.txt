These patches undo changes that I view as detrimental to my user experience.

- Undoes b6bd191cf5bf12231edcb5d8c14ad9994d1dcc97 (https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi/commit/b6bd191cf5bf12231edcb5d8c14ad9994d1dcc97)
  and 24791f0ce5471acf19d286a9b32fe3d3a0791f94 (https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi/commit/24791f0ce5471acf19d286a9b32fe3d3a0791f94).
  
  Resizing and centering floating windows is a direct violation of their intended use case
  and changes the long-standing default behaviour - something Komorebi is usually prone to not do.

  The desperate effort not to create any new options leads to a worse user experience.
