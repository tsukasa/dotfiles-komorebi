These patches undo changes or alter behaviours that I view as detrimental to my user experience.

001_floating_no_center_window.patch
- Undoes b6bd191cf5bf12231edcb5d8c14ad9994d1dcc97 (https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi/commit/b6bd191cf5bf12231edcb5d8c14ad9994d1dcc97)
  and 24791f0ce5471acf19d286a9b32fe3d3a0791f94 (https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi/commit/24791f0ce5471acf19d286a9b32fe3d3a0791f94).
  
  Resizing and centering floating windows is a direct violation of their intended use case
  and changes the long-standing default behaviour - something Komorebi is usually prone to not do.

  2025-04-21: Patch is no longer necessary, starting with commit 86e78570d6db382fb04742f17eea8da4a97acff2
              the behaviour is finally configurable.

002_scrolling_adjust_min_windows.patch
- Adjust the way the new Scrolling window layout (https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi/commit/b4e61b079cb60f04b8fcf0d7203419ad083528f4)
  handles the minimum number of windows before scrolling.

  By default, Komorebi treats 2 windows or less as the columns layout, despite there being
  a configuration entry for the number of windows.

  This patch replaces the hardcoded default with the configurable number from the configuration
  layout_options, which allow per-workspace configuration of this parameter.
